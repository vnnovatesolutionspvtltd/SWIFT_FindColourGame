# SWift_FindColourGame
it's simple swift find different colour game.


This is a sample project students or kids can use to learn how to find difference colour in three colours.

Here is an addition by me

We can have a bit of fun with this repo, knowing that we can always reset it to a known good state.  We can apply labels, and branch, then add new code and merge it in to the master branch.

As a quick reminder, this came from one of three locations in either SSH, Git, or HTTPS format:

*https://github.com/vnnovatesolutionspvtltd/SWift_FindColour.git

We can, as an example effort, even modify this README and change it as if it were source code for the purposes of the class.


This demo also includes an image with changes on a branch for examination of image diff on GitHub.
